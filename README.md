# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I love learning new technologies and experimenting with them in my projects.  
I'm interested in **backend, frontend, mobile development, and DevOps**.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies I work with:
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript  
- **Mobile Development**: Previously worked with UIKit (can build mid-level projects), now learning React Native for cross-platform apps  
- **DevOps**: Just getting started â€“ have experience with Docker and Nginx, want to learn more

### ðŸ“Œ Currently learning:
- **React Native** â€“ focusing on cross-platform development  
- **Next.js** â€“ exploring SSR/SSG  
- **WebSockets** â€“ want to try real-time features in projects  
- **CI/CD** â€“ looking to improve deployment automation

âš¡ Always curious to learn something new and apply it in practice!
